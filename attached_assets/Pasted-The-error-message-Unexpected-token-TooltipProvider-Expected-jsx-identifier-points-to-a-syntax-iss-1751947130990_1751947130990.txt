The error message "Unexpected token TooltipProvider. Expected jsx identifier" points to a syntax issue in your JSX code, specifically where you're using the <TooltipProvider> component. This kind of error in a React/Next.js application, especially within a .tsx file, usually stems from a few common problems.

Potential Errors
Here's a breakdown of the likely culprits:

Missing or Incorrect Imports: The most frequent cause of this error is that the TooltipProvider component, while used in the JSX, hasn't been correctly imported at the top of your file. If the component isn't in scope, the JSX parser doesn't recognize it as a valid element.

Improper Component Usage or Naming: There might be a typo in the component name (TooltipProvider) either in the import statement or in the JSX itself. It's also possible that TooltipProvider is not the correct component to be used as a wrapper and should be used differently according to the library's documentation.

File Not Saved as .tsx: Since you are using JSX syntax, the file must have a .tsx (or .jsx) extension. If it was accidentally saved as a regular .ts file, the TypeScript compiler wouldn't know how to handle the JSX syntax.

Configuration Issues: Less commonly, there might be a misconfiguration in your tsconfig.json file. Specifically, the jsx compiler option might not be set correctly (e.g., it should be "react-jsx" or "preserve").

Dependency Problems: There could be an issue with the installation of the UI library you are using (which appears to be shadcn/ui or a similar library). A corrupted or incomplete installation of @radix-ui/react-tooltip (which is what shadcn/ui often uses under the hood) could lead to this problem.

Replit AI Prompt:

"I'm encountering a JSX parsing error in my Next.js application, specifically with the TooltipProvider component in the horarios-display.tsx file. The error message is Unexpected token TooltipProvider. Expected jsx identifier.

Please analyze the provided horarios-display.tsx file and correct the issue. Specifically, I need you to:

Verify Imports: Check if TooltipProvider is correctly imported from @/components/ui/tooltip. If it's missing, please add the correct import statement.

Check JSX Syntax: Ensure that the usage of <TooltipProvider> wrapping the main div is syntactically correct and that there are no typos.

Validate Dependencies: Although you can't directly check my package.json, please make sure the code is written in a way that is consistent with the latest versions of shadcn/ui and @radix-ui/react-tooltip.

Review tsconfig.json (if possible): If you can infer any necessary tsconfig.json settings, please advise. For instance, ensure the jsx property is correctly set for a Next.js project.

Please provide the corrected code for horarios-display.tsx."
